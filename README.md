# Semantic Version for SAP Releases

Since SAP does not use semantic versioning for components of ABAP systems, this class implements a bi-directional mapping between the two covering as many cases as possible.

## Usage

Derive semantic version from SAP release:

```abap
DATA(semver) = NEW zcl_semver_sap( ).

WRITE semver->sap_release_to_semver( '750' ). " 7.50.0
" with support package
WRITE semver->sap_release_to_semver( release = '750' support_pack = '0012' ). " 7.50.12
```

Convert SAP release to semantic version:

```abap
WRITE semver->semver_to_sap_release( '7.50.0' ). " 750
" with support package
semver->semver_to_sap_release_sp(
  EXPORTING
    version      = '7.50.12'
  IMPORTING
    release      = release         " 750
    support_pack = support_pack ). " 0000000012
```

Get semantic version for installed SAP component:

```abap
WRITE semver->sap_component_to_semver( 'SAP_BASIS' ). " 758
```

See the code and test classes for mapping of other "strange SAP release formats" like 1909 or 2011_1_731.
